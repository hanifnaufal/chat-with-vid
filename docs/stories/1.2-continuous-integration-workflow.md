# Story 1.2: Continuous Integration Workflow

## Status
Draft

## Story
As a developer,
I want a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically runs checks on every pull request,
so that I can ensure code quality, maintainability, and prevent regressions from being merged into the main branch.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A new GitHub Actions workflow file is created in .github/workflows/.
- The workflow automatically triggers on any pull request targeting the main branch.
- The workflow installs dependencies for both the api (Python) and web (Next.js) applications.
- The workflow runs all linter checks (e.g., Ruff/Black for Python, ESLint/Prettier for the frontend).
- The workflow executes the complete unit and integration test suite (as defined in your Technical Assumptions).
- The workflow must successfully pass before a pull request is permitted to be merged (requires configuration of branch protection rules in GitHub).

## Tasks
