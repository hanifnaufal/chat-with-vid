# Story 1.1: Project Scaffolding & Setup

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a complete project structure with all necessary dependencies and local services running in Docker,
**so that** I can begin developing features in a consistent and reproducible environment.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A monorepo is created containing separate packages for the api (FastAPI) and web (Next.js) applications.
2. All dependencies listed in the technical assumptions (Next.js, FastAPI, etc.) are installed.
3. A docker-compose.yml file is created to run PostgreSQL database, FastAPI backend, and Next.js frontend locally.
4. The web and api applications can be started successfully with a single command using Docker.
5. A README.md file is created with clear instructions for initial setup using Docker (as per FR8).

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Create monorepo structure with apps/api and apps/web directories (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Set up apps/api directory for FastAPI backend
  - [ ] Set up apps/web directory for Next.js frontend
- [ ] Configure backend dependencies with Poetry (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create pyproject.toml with required dependencies (FastAPI, LangChain, SQLAlchemy, etc.)
  - [ ] Install all backend dependencies
- [ ] Configure frontend dependencies with npm (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Initialize Next.js application in apps/web
  - [ ] Install all frontend dependencies
- [ ] Create docker-compose.yml for all services (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Define PostgreSQL service with appropriate configuration
  - [ ] Define FastAPI backend service with proper build configuration
  - [ ] Define Next.js frontend service with proper build configuration
  - [ ] Set up environment variables for all services
  - [ ] Configure proper networking between services
- [ ] Implement startup scripts for both applications (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Create script to start all services with Docker Compose
  - [ ] Create script to start services in development mode with hot reloading
- [ ] Create comprehensive README.md with setup instructions (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Include Docker as the primary method for running the application
  - [ ] Document how to start all services with a single command
  - [ ] Include alternative direct installation steps for development
  - [ ] Add basic usage instructions

## Dev Notes
### Source Tree Structure
The project will follow a monorepo structure with separate directories for the API and web applications:

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python 3.12 with FastAPI 0.111.0 framework (running in Docker)
- **Frontend**: Next.js for the web application (running in Docker)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL managed via Docker
- **LLM Integration**: LangChain with langchain-google-genai
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy 2.0 with psycopg (v3) driver
- **Dependency Management**: Poetry for backend, npm for frontend
- **Containerization**: Docker and Docker Compose for local development
- **Code Quality**: Ruff & Black for linting and formatting

[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]

### Coding Standards
- All backend code must be written in Python ~3.12
- Code must be formatted with Black and pass all linting checks from Ruff
- Tests must be located in the apps/api/tests directory following the naming convention test_*.py
- Use the Repository Pattern for all database interactions
- Centralized Exception Handling with custom business exceptions
- Structured Logging Only - do not use print()
- Secure API Key Handling via configuration service
- Use LangChain Chains for all LLM interactions

[Source: architecture/13-coding-standards.md]

### Testing Standards
- Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology with Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- Use pytest as the testing framework
- Tests must be located in apps/api/tests directory, mirroring the application structure
- Use unittest.mock or pytest-mock for mocking
- AI Agent must follow TDD cycle: write failing test first, then implementation, then refactor
- Integration tests will test service layer against a real database instance
- Use pytest fixtures for test data management
- CI pipeline with GitHub Actions will run entire test suite and linter checks on every pull request

[Source: architecture/14-test-strategy-and-standards.md]

### Project Architecture
- **Architectural Style**: Decoupled Client-Server with Next.js frontend and FastAPI backend
- **Repository Structure**: Monorepo to keep api and web applications together
- **Service Architecture**: FastAPI as dedicated backend API server handling requests, database interactions, and interfacing with external services
- **Containerization**: All services (PostgreSQL, FastAPI, Next.js) will run in Docker containers for local development
- **Development Workflow**: Docker Compose will be used to orchestrate all services with a single command
- **Data Flow**: User submits URL via frontend → request to FastAPI backend → async job fetches YouTube data → transcript sent to Gemini API for analysis → frontend polls backend for status updates
