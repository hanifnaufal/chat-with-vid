# 14. Test Strategy and Standards
### Testing Philosophy
- **Approach**: All backend development must follow the Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology, using the "Red-Green-Refactor" cycle.
- **Coverage Goals**: TDD naturally drives test coverage towards 100%. The primary goal is ensuring all functionality is driven by a test.

### Test Types and Organization
#### Unit Tests
- **Framework**: pytest
- **File Convention**: Tests will be located in the apps/api/tests directory, mirroring the application structure.

- **Mocking Library**: unittest.mock or pytest-mock.

- **AI Agent Requirements**: The AI development agent must follow the TDD cycle for all new functionality:
    - First, generate a new test file or add a new test case to an existing file that clearly defines a requirement and is confirmed to fail.
    - Second, write the application code in the appropriate service or repository to make the failing test pass.
    - Third, review the implemented code for potential refactoring opportunities to improve its structure and readability.

#### Integration Tests
- **Scope**: TDD will also be applied at the integration level, testing the service layer against a real database instance.
- **Test Infrastructure**: A dedicated, containerized PostgreSQL database managed by Docker Compose will be used for tests.

#### Test Data Management
- **Strategy**: pytest fixtures will be used to manage test data, ensuring tests are isolated and repeatable.

#### Continuous Testing
- **CI Integration**: A foundational CI pipeline using GitHub Actions will be implemented as part of the initial project setup. This pipeline will run the entire test suite and all linter checks on every pull request, blocking merges if tests fail. This CI workflow is a core part of the MVP development process and is distinct from the future Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline discussed in Section 11.
