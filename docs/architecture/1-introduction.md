# 1. Introduction
This document outlines the overall project architecture for Chat with Video, including backend systems, shared services, and non-UI specific concerns. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies.

### Relationship to Frontend Architecture:
If the project includes a significant user interface, a separate Frontend Architecture Document will detail the frontend-specific design and MUST be used in conjunction with this document. Core technology stack choices documented herein (see "Tech Stack") are definitive for the entire project, including any frontend components.

### Starter Template or Existing Project
The project is a greenfield application. The frontend will be scaffolded using create-next-app. The backend will be a manual setup from scratch using Python and FastAPI to provide maximum control over the configuration.
