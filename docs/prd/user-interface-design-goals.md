# User Interface Design Goals
### Overall UX Vision
The user experience should be clean, fast, and conversational. The primary goal is to make a complex backend process feel simple and intuitive. Users should feel like they are interacting with a knowledgeable assistant who is an expert on the video's content. The interface must prioritize clarity and efficiency, getting the user from a URL to an answer with the least possible friction.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Conversational Interface**: The core interaction will be a standard chat UI (like a messaging app) with a user input field at the bottom and a scrolling history of questions and answers.

- **Streaming Responses**: To enhance the feeling of a live conversation and meet performance goals (NFR2), answers from the LLM will stream in token by token.

- **Suggested Actions**: To guide users, the interface will present clickable "suggested questions" (FR9) after the initial summary is generated.

### Core Screens and Views
- **Home/Input Screen**: A minimalist page with a single, clear call-to-action: a text input field for the user to paste a YouTube URL and a "Process Video" button.

- **Analysis/Chat Screen**: The main workspace. It will initially display the video's metadata and the generated summary/actionables (FR4, FR7). Below this, the interactive chat interface will allow for conversation.

- **Chat History Screen**: A view that displays the list of saved conversations, showing the rich metadata for each (thumbnail, title, channel, etc., as per FR7). Clicking an item will navigate the user to the Analysis/Chat Screen for that video.

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
To ensure the application is usable by the widest possible audience and reflects a high-quality portfolio piece, the target will be WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance.

### Branding
Branding for the MVP will be minimal, focusing on a clean, modern, and trustworthy aesthetic that prioritizes content and usability. The color palette should be simple (e.g., a primary blue for interactive elements, with dark text on a light background) to ensure high readability.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
The application will be designed with a mobile-first, responsive approach to ensure a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile web browsers.
