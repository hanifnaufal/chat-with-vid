# Goals and Background Context
### Goals
- **Showcase Full-Stack & LLM Expertise**: Create a high-quality, open-source project that serves as a professional portfolio piece, demonstrating advanced skills in modern full-stack web development and practical LLM integration.

- **Build a Community Asset**: Develop a tool that is genuinely useful to the community, attracting engagement and establishing a positive reputation.

- **Encourage Collaboration**: Foster a small but active community by making the project easy to set up and contribute to, highlighting skills in creating maintainable codebases.

- **High Utility**: Ensure the tool is actively used when run locally, proving its real-world value.

- **Developer Friendliness**: A new contributor can successfully set up the local development environment and run tests in under 30 minutes.

### Background Context
The primary problem this project addresses is the inefficiency of retrieving specific information from long-form educational or informational YouTube videos. Users like students, researchers, and professionals often need precise answers or summaries but are forced to manually scrub through video timelines, which is time-consuming and cumbersome.

This project proposes a web application that transforms the passive viewing experience into an interactive, queryable knowledge base. By inputting a YouTube URL, users can engage in a conversational chat with the video's content, asking questions and receiving context-aware answers generated by an LLM (Gemini). This provides a significant advantage over existing solutions like static transcripts or basic summarizers by allowing for deep, interactive exploration of the video's content.
